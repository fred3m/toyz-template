Template for new Toyz
=====================
This repository contains a template to create new toyz built on the 
[Toyz for Data Reduction and Analysis](https://github.com/fred3m/toyz) framework.

To get started fork this repository and rename it to your new python module.

In the future there will be more thorough documentation and a getting started tutorial
for creating your own toyz. For now see the Toyz [documentation](http://fred3m.github.io/toyz/).
